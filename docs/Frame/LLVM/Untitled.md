1. SSA
>In compiler design, static single assignment form (often abbreviated as SSA form or simply SSA) is a property of an intermediate representation (IR), which requires that each variable is assigned exactly once, and every variable is defined before it is used.
- 每个变量只赋值一次

2. ABI
- Application Binary Interface 二进制接口
- 可以不经修改在支持同样ABI的系统上运行程序
