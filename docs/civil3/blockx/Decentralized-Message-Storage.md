## Why decentralized storage?

1. Big file or data like image are too expensive to store in chain
2. The **performance** of chain are too low
3. Your cloud store won't collapse / be banned / be delete

### Node or API Provider
- Everything have its own price
- If we want to interact with chain, we need to maintain ourselves' `node`
- Or use the `API` from the provider, they have deployed a number of node for services:
	- `Infura`
	- `Alchemy`

- On `ipfs`, you need  the `CID` (Content ID)  and through `IPNS` to find specific files.
- `CID`  (content-based address)  a series of hashed characters like wallet key
