## Current  Task

default - POC
1. Token test contract erc20
2. NFT test contract erc721
3. Golang backend (my plan)
4. A test net 

## Additional

For now ,  we  need to deploy some normal  contracts  as soon as possible.
And develop the interfaces of that for front-end.

- Why Golang?
Our  team's main lang was chosen as Golang, hopefully with no other languages for additional problem between langs.

- And then?
Need to develop some contracts that are upgradeable. For maintaining and iterating.
